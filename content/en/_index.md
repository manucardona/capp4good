**CAPP4Good** is a student-led initiative at the University of Chicago dedicated to using technology and data to address pressing public challenges.  
By bringing together students, researchers, and practitioners, the organization creates spaces for collaboration where civic technology and computational techniques are applied to issues such as poverty, justice, health, education, gender equity, and environmental sustainability.

Through hackathons, lightning talks, and hands-on projects, **CAPP4Good** empowers students to explore how innovative tools can generate solutions with real social impact.  
The goal is not only to expand technical skills, but also to foster a community that values creativity, collaboration, and a commitment to the public good.
